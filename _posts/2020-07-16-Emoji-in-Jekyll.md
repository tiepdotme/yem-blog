Add the following to your site's `Gemfile`

```sh
gem 'jemoji'
```

And add the following to your site's `_config.yml`

```sh
plugins:
  - jemoji
```

> If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the gems key instead of plugins.

In any page or post, use emoji as you would normally, e.g.

```sh
I give this plugin two :+1:!
```
