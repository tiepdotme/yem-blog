The `rel="noopener"` is an attribute used in `<a>` elements (hyperlinks). It prevents pages from having a window.opener property, which would otherwise point to the page from where the link was opened and would allow the page opened from the hyperlink to manipulate the page where the hyperlink is.

### Good to hear

-   `rel="noopener"` is applied to hyperlinks.
-   `rel="noopener"` prevents opened links from manipulating the source page.
